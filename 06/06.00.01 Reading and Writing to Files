A key function for working with files in Python is the open() statement. The open() statement takes two parameters: filename, and mode.

There are four different modes for opening a file:

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, an error occurs if the file does not exist
"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending (adding data to the end of a file), creates the file if it does not exist
"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist; overwrites all data already in the file.
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode:

"t" - Text - Default value. File has letters and numbers; each line terminated with a linefeed
"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images). File has unprintable characters, such as photos videos, and sound files.

print("line1\nline2\n\nline4")

The open() Statement
Before you can access a file, you must open it by name using the open() statement. If you open "06.00.00 DemoText.txt", it is assumed that the file is in the root of the file system. If the file is in a folder, say "IFSC1202", then you would specify "IFSC1202/06.00.00 DemoText.txt".

demofile = open("06.00.00 DemoText.txt")
The code above is the same as:

demofile = open("06.00.00 DemoText.txt", "rt")
Because "r" for read, and "t" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them. Note: Make sure the file exists, or else you will get an error.

The .read() method
The .read() method is used to read an entire file. The all lines of the contents (including any linefeeds) are placed in a string.

x = demotextfile.read()
Displaying the File Contents
You can display the contents of the file by simply printing it. Note: what happens when a linefeed is printed...output is advanced to the beginning of the new line.

print(x)
Closing the File
When you are finished with the file, you should use the .close() method to close the file to release all of the resources associated with the file.

demotextfile.close()
